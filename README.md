# Chronos

Chronos is a reflective daily journaling web application designed to be filled out gradually over the course of a year. It uses a central tree of growth as a visual and conceptual metaphor for personal development, consistency, and time-based progression.

**Live Website:** https://chronos-nu.vercel.app

## Overview

Chronos encourages users to engage in short, intentional daily reflection rather than long-form journaling. Each entry contributes to the growth of a central tree, allowing progress over time to be seen visually rather than measured purely through text or metrics.

The application is designed to feel calm, private, and sustainable for long-term use.

## Core Concept

- Daily reflection as a habit, not a task
- Time represented through organic visual growth
- A year-long journey rather than isolated entries
- Progress shown visually instead of numerically

## Key Features

- Daily journal entries
- Central tree of growth that evolves over time
- Year-based structure for long-term reflection
- Minimal, distraction-free interface
- Fully client-side experience

## Design Philosophy

Chronos avoids productivity pressure and gamification. The interface is intentionally slow and thoughtful, encouraging consistency, honesty, and self-awareness rather than optimisation.

The tree of growth serves as both a memory anchor and a visual narrative of the year.

## Technology

- Modern JavaScript framework
- Client-side rendering and state management
- Deployed on Vercel

## Intended Use

Chronos is meant to be visited briefly each day. Small entries accumulate meaning over time, forming a visual record of growth, reflection, and continuity.

## Future Scope

- Multi-year journaling views
- Deeper reflection prompts
- Exportable personal archives
- Accessibility and theming options
